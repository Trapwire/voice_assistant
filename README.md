# Voice Assistant

Trapwire is a voice assistant program created using Python. It uses the SpeechRecognition library to recognize voice and perform various tasks, such as searching Wikipedia, opening websites, playing music, and more.

## Installation

To use Trapwire, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the following libraries:

- pyttsx3

You can install these libraries using pip, the package installer for Python. Open a command prompt or terminal window and enter the following commands:

```
pip install pyttsx3

## Usage

To use Trapwire, simply run the `trapwire.py` file using Python. The program will greet you and wait for your voice command. You can say things like:

- "Wikipedia [search term]"
